# Data Analysis Project: Flying Meals

Welcome to my Business Intelligence Analysis Cycle project! This repository showcases the final project I completed as part of my BI Analysis Cycle.

## Project Overview
This project centers on an innovative startup idea that aims to tackle the issue of limited food choices at airports during specific timeslots. Through the utilization of various BI techniques and tools, our objective is to explore viable solutions, such as offering meal boxes, to enhance the dining options for passengers in these situations. We will analyze data using techniques like data visualization, statistical analysis, and data modeling to gain valuable insights and provide data-driven recommendations. Additionally, we will explore potential collaborations with airlines to effectively implement this innovative idea and improve the overall passenger experience.

## Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, SQL

Data Manipulation and Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
